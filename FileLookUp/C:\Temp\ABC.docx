Much of South Africa is tinder dry.  Veld, forest and mountain fires sweep across the land, causing immense damage to property and destroying valuable forest, flora and fauna.  The Forest Act 122 of 1984 (the \'93Act\'94
) has as one of its principal objects the 
prevention and control of such fires.  A major method of achieving this is to create various fire control areas where schemes of compulsory fire control are established, with special emphasis on the clearing and maintenance of fire belts between neighbour
ing properties.}{\cs15\fs26\lang2057\langfe1033\super\langnp2057\insrsid3160095 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \qj \fi-720\li720\ri0\sa237\widctlpar\tx-1440\nooverflow\faroman\rin0\lin720\itap0 \fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {

 Wright J came to the opposite conclusion in an action which was also brought under the Act.  His opinion
 that a referral of the constitutionality of section 84 of the Act was, at that stage, not in the interest of justice was based on the probability that either of the parties would be able, without the assistance of the presumption, to either prove or disp
r
ove the negligence of the defendant.  It is neither necessary nor desirable to attempt to resolve the apparent conflict between the conclusions of Van der Walt DJP and Wright J because every case must be decided on its own particular facts and circumstanc
e
s and what is essentially a judgment on the peculiar facts and pleadings before a judge requested to refer a matter in terms of section 102(1) cannot be elevated to a rule of law which is capable of automatic application to the referral of all other cases
 brought under the Act.

r
ed that there was a reasonable prospect of the section being declared unconstitutional, but at the time that the referral was made there was little guidance on the construction of section 8, which is a matter of some complexity.  Under these circumstances
 
it is fair to infer that, at the time and in the context of the referral, Van der Walt DJP must have considered that there was such a reasonable prospect.  In any event no useful purpose would be served in the circumstances of this particular case by cons
idering how the applicant\rquote

In his written and oral argument, counsel for the applicant focused primarily on the third point, namely an alleged violation of the right to be presumed innocent, as contained in section 25(3)(c) of the interim Constitution.  The obvious difficulty he ha
d
 to overcome was that the applicant was a defendant in a civil trial and not an accused in a criminal trial.  In order to circumvent this problem, he argued that the test to be adopted was an objective one, which did not depend upon the subjective situati
on of the applicant, but rather on the objective reach of the provision.  Thus, if the impugned section, objectively speaking, was unconstitutional, it would be of no force and effect for civil as well as criminal trials.  The word \'93action\'94
, he contended, was ambiguous and had to be read in its context, particularly in relation to the fact that the Afrikaans text used the word \'93geding\'94, which corresponded to the wide English term \'93proceedings\'94.}{

 interpretation of a statutory provision, but, given more than one reasonably possible construction, to prefer one which 
is consistent with the interim Constitution.  In this respect, ambiguity does not help the applicant.  On the contrary, any ambiguity must be resolved by favouring the construction which keeps the provision constitutionally alive, provided the constructio
n is reasonable.  In keeping with this approach, we have no difficulty in deciding that even if the word \'93action\'94
 was capable of including criminal proceedings, and even if such inclusion resulted in an unconstitutional invasion of a right to a fair crimina
l trial, it was also reasonably capable of a more restricted meaning which excluded criminal trials and thereby avoided unconstitutionality.  It follows that in terms of section 35(2) the latter interpretation would be preferred.  Even if all the assumpti

o
f the new constitutional order.  It is the majority, and not the minority, which has suffered from this legal separateness and disadvantage.  While our country, unfortunately, has great experience in constitutionalising inequality, it is a newcomer when i
t
 comes to ensuring constitutional respect for equality.  At the same time, South Africa shares patterns of inequality found all over the globe, so that any development of doctrine relating to section 8 would have to take account both of our specific situa
t
ion and of the problems which our country shares with the rest of humanity.  All this reinforces the idea that this Court should be astute not to lay down sweeping interpretations at this stage but should allow equality doctrine to develop slowly and, hop
efully, surely.  This is clearly an area where issues should be dealt with incrementally and on a case by case basis with special emphasis on the actual context in which each problem arises.

The idea of differentiation (to employ a neutral descriptive term) seems to lie at the heart of equality jurisprudence in general and of the section 8 right or rights in particular.   Taking as comprehensive a view as possible of the way equality is 
treated in section 8, we would suggest that it deals with differentiation in basically two ways:  differentiation which does not involve unfair discrimination and differentiation which does involve unfair discrimination.  This needs some elaboration.  We 
deal with the former first.

It must be accepted that, in order to govern a modern country efficiently and to harmonise the interests of all its people for the common good, it is essential to regulate the affairs of it
s inhabitants extensively.  It is impossible to do so without differentiation and without classifications which treat people differently and which impact on people differently.  It is unnecessary to give examples which abound in everyday life in all democ

acies based on equality and freedom.  Differentiation which falls into this category very rarely constitutes unfair discrimination in respect of persons subject to such regulation, without the addition of a further element.  What this further element is w
ill be considered later.

Accordingly, before it can be said that mere differentiation infringes section 8 it must be established that there is no rational relationship between the differentiation in question and the governmental purpose which is proffered 
to validate it.  In the absence of such rational relationship the differentiation would infringe section 8.  But while the existence of such a rational relationship is a necessary condition for the differentiation not to infringe section 8, it is not a su
fficient condition; for the differentiation might still constitute unfair discrimination if that further element, referred to above, is present.

It is to section 8(2) that one must look in order to determine what thi

 with unfair discrimination.  It does so by distinguishing between two forms of unfair discrimination and dealing with them differently.

The first form relates to certain specifically enumerated grounds (\'93specified grounds\'94
) on the basis whereof no person may unfairly be discriminated against.  The specified grounds are race, gender, sex, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture or language.  When ther
e is prima facie proof of discrimination on these grounds it is presumed, in terms of subsection (4), that unfair discrimination has been sufficiently proved, until the contrary is established.  These are not the only grounds which would constitute unfair
 discrimination.  The words \'93without derogating from the generality of this provision\'94
, which introduce the specified grounds, make it clear that the specified grounds are not exhaustive.  The second form is constituted by unfair discrimination on grounds w
hich are not specified in the subsection.  In regard to this second form there is no presumption in favour of unfairness.

The question arises as to what grounds of discrimination this second form includes.  A purely literal reading and application of the phrase \'93without derogating from the generality of this provision\'94
 would lead to the conclusion that discrimination on any ground whatsoever is proscribed, provided it is unfair.  Such a reading would provide no guidan
ce as to what unfair meant in regard to this second form of discrimination.  It would provide very little, if any, guidance in deciding when a differentiation which passed the rational relationship threshold constituted unfair discrimination.  It also see
m
s unlikely that the content of the concept unfair discrimination would be left to unguided judicial judgment.  We are of the view, however, that when read in its full historical and evolutionary context and in the light of the purpose of section 8 as a wh
ole, and section 8(2) in particular, the second form of unfair discrimination cannot be given such an extremely wide and unstructured meaning.

Proper weight must be given to the use of the word \'93discrimination\'94 in sub
section (2).  The drafters of section 8 did not, for example, follow the model of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which, in paragraph 1 thereof, refers only to the denial of \'93the equal protection of the laws.\'94
  Section 8(1) certainly positively enacts the encompassing and important right to \'93equality before the law and to equal protection of the law\'94, but section 8 does not stop there.  It goes further and in section 8(2) proscribes \'93

  Although one thinks in the first instance of discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin one should never lose sight in any historical evaluation of other forms of discrimination such as t
hat which has taken place on the grounds of sex and gender.  In our view unfair discrimination, when used in this second form in section 8(2), in the context of section 8 as a whole, principally means treating persons differently in a way which impairs th
eir fundamental dignity as human beings, who are inherently equal in dignity.

Since the adoption of the interim Constitution, the provisions of section 8 have bee
n referred to in a number of reported Supreme Court judgments.  In some the reference has been somewhat in passing; in others provisions have been held to be merely regulatory while in certain instances they have been held to constitute a clear breach of 
t
he section 8(2) prohibition against unfair discrimination.  The question whether, and to what extent, the protection of section 8 may be invoked by juristic persons has also been considered.  None of these cases has been concerned with the constitutionali
t
y of a statutory onus provision in civil cases.  Nor has an attempt been made in any of them to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the proper interpretation of section 8 and in particular the relationship between  section 8(1) and 8(2).  It therefore doe
s not seem necessary for us to consider or comment on any of them individually.

Turning now to the case before us, it is necessary in the first place to enquire whether the necessary rational relationship exists betwe
en the purpose sought to be achieved by section 84 of the Act and the means sought to achieve it.  The objectives of the Act as set out in the long title, are \'93
[t]o provide for . . . the prevention and combating of veld, forest and mountain fires; . . . and matters connected therewith.\'94
  In essence, applicant contended that section 84 lacked rationality because it did not use the least onerous means of achieving its objectives.  This approach, however, is based on two misconceptions.  First, the applicant i
s prematurely importing a criterion for justification into a test to be applied at the infringement enquiry (definitional or threshold) stage.  The question of whether the legislation could have been tailored in a different and more acceptable way is rele
v
ant to the issue of justification, but irrelevant to the question of whether there is a sufficient relationship between the means chosen and the end sought, for purposes of the present enquiry.  Second, underlying the argument is an assumption that someho
w there should be a \'93presumption of innocence\'94 in civil matters as weighty and untouchable as that in criminal cases, so that a reverse onus in a civil matter should be as vulnerable to impeachment as one in a criminal trial.

In regard to the first misconception, a person seeking to impugn the constitutionality of a legislative classification cannot simply rely on the fact that the state objective could have been achieved in a better way.  As long as there is a rationa
l relationship between the method and object it is irrelevant that the object could have been achieved in a different way.  In any civil case, one of the parties will have to bear the onus on each of the factual matters material to the adjudication of the
 
dispute. So, in the case of an aquilian claim for damages arising from a veld fire, one of the parties will bear the onus concerning negligence.  As long as the imposition of the onus is not arbitrary, there will be no breach of section 8(1).  In rare cir
cumstances, it may be that the allocation of onus will impair other constitutional rights and a challenge will then arise.  That is not the case here.

  Persons are left in the dark as to what steps their neighbours have taken to avert fires.  The
 causes of the fire and its spread will often be peculiarly within the knowledge of the neighbour.  The specific duties imposed on landowners in fire control areas are accordingly counterbalanced by the general inducement contained in section 84 for those
 
responsible for land in non-controlled areas to be specially vigilant lest they find themselves saddled with responsibility for damage caused by fire spreading from their land.  The purpose of section 23 of Act 72 of 1968, the predecessor of the present s

It was argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the presumption was created in recognition of the peculiar difficulties faced by a person who suffers damage as a result of a fire whose origin he may be wholl

 law responsible and the manner in which the fire was dealt with, if at all, by him or by his servants or agents.  This, I think, is undoubtedly correct.  Furthermore, a person who has suffered as a result of a fire which has come from another\rquote

The main ground on which th
e defendant bases his contention is the store that he sets by section 25(3)(c) of the interim Constitution.   No part of that touched civil matters.  It dealt only with criminal prosecutions.  The right to a fair trial was guaranteed by subsection (3),  b
ut explicitly and solely to persons accused of crimes.   Paragraph (c) then proclaimed the presumption of innocence and the privilege of silence as particular features of that general right, and therefore as those enjoyable under it by such persons alone.

  Counsel who represented the defendant maintained that subsection (3)(c) was nevertheless pertinent to the present proceeding
s.   His argument went like this.   Section 84 covered all matters indiscriminately, embracing civil and criminal ones alike.   It was constitutionally objectionable in its application to criminal cases,  since there it provided for a reverse onus of the 
k
ind which, on the very strength of subsection (3)(c), we had condemned in comparable situations posed on several earlier occasions, holding that the reversal violated the presumption of innocence.   The defect tainted the entire section.  It was consequen
tly invalid as a whole, and thus in a civil as well as a criminal setting.

The statute creates a host of crimes and a wide variety also.  Negligence is specified as an element of merely one which has caught my eye, th

Whether the space was filled is a different matter.   That sounds doubtful, to say the least.   Section 84 speaks of \'93any action\'94, not of \'93any proceedings\'94
 as its statutory predecessors did in section 23 of the Forest Act (72 of 1968) and section 26 of the Forest and Veld Conservation Act (13 of 1941).     The word \'93action\'94, when used with reference to forms of  legal pr
ocedure, denotes in common parlance the civil type.   One does not normally describe a criminal prosecution as an \'93action\'94
, and we were told of no other legislation which had attached that label to any.   Nor have I managed to find a single reported case w
here section 84  has been brought to bear on criminal proceedings.   The current statute seems itself, I mention in parenthesis, to recognise the distinction in terminology.  For section 83(1), which enacts its own separate presumption, applies that speci
fically to every  \'93prosecution  for  an offence\'94.   The defendant\rquote s counsel drew our  attention to  the word \'93geding\'94, which appeared in the Afrikaans text of  section 84 as the  counterpart  to \'93action\'94
 and tended to have broader connotations.  The English
 text was the one signed.   But that is not a conclusive consideration.  The Afrikaans version remains relevant, even so,  to the interpretation of the section.  Yet it takes the matter no further.  The reason is a helpful rule of statutory construction c
a
tering for the situation that we have here, where the one text happens to be couched in terms which are wider than but encompass those of  the other.   The texts must then be reconciled, ordinarily at any rate and especially when they impose fresh burdens
, by attributing to the legislation the narrower meaning, since that is the denominator common to both.}{\cs15\fs26\lang2057\langfe1033\super\langnp2057\insrsid3160095 3{\footnote \pard\plain \qj \fi-720\li720\ri0\sa237\widctlpar

own, to discrimination or unequal treatment in the constitutional sense.  The law differentiates between categories of people on innumerable scores which sound unobjectionable and may often be unavoidable.   A few examples that spring to mind straight awa
y
 are their levels of income at which the rate of the tax assessed on that is fixed, their ages when or the length of their employment before pensions become payable to them, and the criteria for their entitlement to the benefits of social welfare.  What s

rely counts at least in those and all other instances of differentiation is always how rational in its basis, nature, scope and objectives the particular one appears to be, and sometimes how fair it also looks in those respects.  It follows that I cannot 
imagine our denunciation of any differentiation which we evaluated as both fair and rational.

Manifestly the presumption created by the section cannot be invoked merely by averring negligence, without anything more.  The contesting submissions of the parties centre around what additional averment or proof is required of
 a plaintiff to entitle him to call the presumption in aid.  More specifically, the real enquiry is whether or not the terms of the section embrace the duty of care.  For defendant it was argued that, inasmuch as negligence is the breach of a legal duty, 
no \lquote question of negligence arises\rquote 
 unless and until the particular duty of care which a plaintiff claims to have been breached is first established.  Counsel for the plaintiff, on the other hand, submitted that both the duty of care and the breach thereof f
all within the ambit of the section . . . .  I do not find it necessary for the decision of this appeal to pursue counsel\rquote

servant of the defendant, or indeed by any human agency, does not in my opinion by itself relieve the defendant of responsibility for the damage sustained by plaintiff.  Consequently, the latter\rquote 
s averments of negligence in relation to the fire which cause
d it damage, coupled with proof that the fire . . . emanated from (and also originated upon) landed property owned and controlled by defendant, sufficed, in my judgment, to bring the case within the ambit of section 23.  The effect of this was that the on

The characteristic . . . of this burden of proof  (in the sense of a risk of nonpersuasion)  in legal controversies is
 that the law divides the process into stages and apportions definitely to each party the specific facts which will in turn fall to him as the prerequisites of obtaining action in his favor by the tribunal.  It is this apportionment which forms the import
a
nt element of controversy for legal purposes.  Each party wishes to know of what facts he has the risk of nonpersuasion.  By what considerations is this apportionment determined?  Is there any single principle or rule which will solve all cases and afford
 
a general test for ascertaining the incidence of this risk?  By no means.  It is often said that the burden is upon the party having in form the affirmative allegation.  But this is not an invariable test, nor even always a significant circumstance; the b
u
rden is often on one who has a negative assertion to prove . . . .  It is sometimes said that it is upon the party  to whose case the fact is essential.  This is correct enough, but it merely advances the inquiry one step; we must then ask whether there i
s any general principle which determines to what party\rquote 
s case a fact is essential.  Still another consideration has often been advanced as a special test for solving a limited class of cases, ie the burden of  proving a fact is said to be put on the party w
ho presumably has peculiar means of knowledge enabling him to prove its falsity if it is false . . . .  But this consideration furnishes no universal working rule . . . .  This consideration, after all, merely takes its place among other considerations of
 fairness and experience as a most important one to be kept in mind in apportioning the burden of proof in a specific case. }{\i\fs22\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid3160095

\par I have quoted at length from the book because the state of affairs existing in South Africa echoes exactly, in all its force and resonance, that description of the American one.  Our common law likewise contains no 
comprehensive rule on the onus of proof in civil proceedings which is inflexibly free from exceptions.  Here too the onus does not always lie upon the plaintiff asserting a claim but, on issues peculiar to the nature of the case, is sometimes borne by the
 
defendant in his or her resistance to that.  One thinks, for instance, of the issues raised when self-defence is pleaded in answer to a claim for damages suffered as the result of an assault, when a contract admitted or proved is said in an action for its
 
enforcement to have been cancelled or novated, when some special defence is presented as a means of escape from liability on a bill of exchange, and when a host of other situations arise in which confessions and avoidances are familiar. Hoffmann and Zeffe

In our adversarial system of civil litigation one side or the other has to bear the onus of proof.  Differentiation between the parties in that regard is thus inevitable.  So is the disa
dvantage under which the side carrying the load often labours.  Its location for specific issues depends not on doctrinaire considerations, but on wholly pragmatic ones.  Veld, forest and mountain fires are calamities with which our country is well acquai
n
ted, and their consequences are frequently disastrous.  In enacting section 84 Parliament evidently believed that the defendants embroiled in the actions which it defined were shown by experience to be better placed than the plaintiffs suing them, by and 
l
arge, for investigations into and the ascertainment of the causes, origins and progress of such fires when they occurred  beyond the strict  supervision  inside  fire  control areas  that  was planned.  The position of the same defendants was apparently t
h
ought in addition to be distinguishable, on the whole, from that occupied by other defendants opposing delictual claims, the general run of those in the first place and the particular group in the second who were blamed for fires that had started on or em
a
nated from land lying within fire control areas.  For no comparably peculiar knowledge or sources of information about the detailed causation of the harmful incidents resulting in the litigation could realistically be imputed, as a rule, to so vast and am
orphous a category of defendants as the first lot.  That goes without saying, given the infinite variety of circumstances relevant to the suits brought against them.  Nor, when it came to the second category of defendants, would a}{

 imposed upon them have been warranted in the conditions prevailing throughout the controlled areas, where fire protection schemes operated, where measures devised to prevent conflagrations and their spread were in force, and where compliance with those w
a
s both compulsory and verifiable.  That is a situation quite unlike the sort encountered elsewhere in which individual landowners are largely left to take their own precautions and they alone know what has or has not been done in that connection.   We may
 
agree or disagree, as we prefer, with the generality of those beliefs or with the way in which effect was given to them.  But the assessment was one falling well within the zone of an essentially legislative judgment.  I can find no substance whatsoever i
n the suggestion that the reaction of Parliament to the scene which it saw was either unfair or irrational once that is viewed in the light of the }{\i\fs26\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid3160095 Quathlamba}{

Two questions which my judgment leaves open, and a couple of possibilities occurring to me that it does not dismiss, will be mentioned in conclusion.  The first question concerns the relationship b

 result I concur in the grant of the order which Ackermann J, O\rquote 
Regan J and Sachs J propose in their joint judgment, the final draft of which I have read since writing this one of mine.  The two judgments differ sometimes in their approach to the issues ca
nvassed, in their emphasis and in the extent to which they elaborate on their reasoning, but not otherwise as far as I can see.  The clearest difference is visible where I have felt able to reach a confident conclusion on the second part of the case witho

t analysing in similar detail either the concepts of equality and non-discrimination or their constitutional interaction.  I do not dissent, however, from the opinions which my colleagues have expressed on those points.  And I had better add, since nothin
g has yet been said by me  about the referral, that I share the view of that taken by them.
